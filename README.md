# fitIMR

This code fits the neo-Hookean Kelvin-Voigt (NHKV) models using the IMR procedure. 

Briefly, bubble dynamics is recorded during laser-induced cavitation experiments in the characterized soft material (e.g., hydrogel). A Keller-Miksis style bubble dynamics model is then used to inversely calibrate the NHKV parameters.
